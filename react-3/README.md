# React-3 ðŸš€

This project continues my React learning journey. In **react-3**, the focus is on understanding **JSX**, **functional components**, and **component composition**.

---

## ðŸ“Œ What I Learned

- **React.createElement** â†’ Creates a React element (JavaScript object) â†’ Rendered into an HTML element.
- **JSX**
  - JSX is a syntax extension that looks like HTML/XML but works inside JavaScript.
  - It is transpiled by **Babel** into `React.createElement()` before execution.
- **Functional Components**
  - Two syntaxes of functional components were explored.
  - Components can return JSX and render dynamic values.
- **Component Composition**
  - Using one component inside another to build UI.

---

## ðŸ›  Code Highlights

- Created React elements using both `React.createElement` and JSX.
- Converted JSX elements into reusable **functional components**.
- Rendered components using `ReactDOM.createRoot`.
- Demonstrated component composition by nesting `Heading2Component` inside `HeadingComponent`.
